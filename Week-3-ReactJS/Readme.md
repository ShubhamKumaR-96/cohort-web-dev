1. Definition of React's useState Hook

useState is a built-in React Hook that allows functional components to manage local state. It provides a way to declare state variables and update them, triggering re-renders when the state changes.

Q1: When should I use functional updates with useState?
A: Always use functional updates when the new state depends on the previous state value. This ensures you're working with the most current state and avoids stale state issues.

// Instead of:
setCount(count + 1);

// Use:
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);


Q2: How should I update objects or arrays in state?
A: Always spread the previous state when updating objects or arrays to maintain immutability and prevent accidental overwrites.

// For objects:
setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, age: 31 }));

// For arrays:
setItems(prev => [...prev, newItem]);


Q3: What's the best way to handle expensive initial state computations?
A: Use lazy initialization by passing a function to useState. This ensures the computation only runs once during the initial render.

// Instead of
const [data, setData] = useState(computeExpensiveValue());

// Use:
const [data, setData] = useState(() => computeExpensiveValue());

Q4: What should I consider about state dependencies in useEffect?
A: Be cautious when including state variables in useEffect dependencies. Ensure your effect doesn't create infinite loops by unnecessarily updating state that triggers the effect.

// Problematic:
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
}, [count]); // Infinite loop!

// Better:
useEffect(() => {
  if (count < maxValue) {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }
}, [count, maxValue]);


Q5: When should I consider using useReducer instead of useState?
A: Switch to useReducer when:
1.You have complex state logic involving multiple sub-values
2.The next state depends on the previous one in non-trivial ways
3.You need to manage state transitions more explicitly
4.The same state needs to be updated from multiple places

// For complex state management:
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
